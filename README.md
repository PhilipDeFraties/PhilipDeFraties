### Hi there, I'm Phil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a capable and driven Software Engineer who loves taking on challenges and working on teams. I spent a lot of time as a healthcare professional learning to be a reliable and communicative team-member across multiple teams for over a decade and am now putting those skills to use as a professional developer. 

My main goal is not only to develop not only well-built applications but also a career path built on continuous growth and driven by a persistent beginner's mindset. My learning is fueled by passion for creation as I find endless satisfaction in refining and refactoring. 

I'm confident working with Rails, Ruby, SQL, JSON, REST API's, Github, Heroku, and CI. I also have some experience with GraphQL, Python / Flask, and JavaScript / Node.js. I'm currently working on a personal project leveraging a Rails backend with GraphQL and PostgreSQL and learning to build a React front-end.

With every team I find myself on I set my intention first thing to be a reliable source of positivity, initiative, and reliability and to be an efficient and considerate communicator. I try to stay active in slack channels, be ready to jump in on pair coding sessions whenever needed, make meaningful commit messages and well-written pull requests, and do thorough code reviews.
