### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a backend software engineer and have recently completed the backend-engineering program at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). 

Turing is a 7-month intensive program that sets itself apart from typical bootcamps by placing an emphasis agile workflows, test-driven development, regular coding challenges, demanding team and solo projects requiring deep learning and exploration, and continuous lectures on the importance of maintaining an open and inclusive environment conduscive to personal and professional growth.

My main goal is not only to develop not only well-built applications but also a career path built on continuous growth and driven by a persistent beginner's mindset. My learning is fueled by passion for creation as I find endless satisfaction in refining and refactoring. 

I'm most familiar with Ruby and its framework, Rails and have built several REST API's as well as consumed external API's and have even built a microservice leveraging Sinatra to do so.One application I am proud of, [Viewing Party](https://github.com/PhilipDeFraties/viewing_party), assigned to myself and my team of 2 others, is a good example of my experience with Ruby on Rails. It recieved a full-score and lovely compliments from our instructor.

Feel free to poke around as I continue to evolve my portfolio and skillset. I am open to career opportunities and can be reached by email at philip.defraties@gmail.com or through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/).
