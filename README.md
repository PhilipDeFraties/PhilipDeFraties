I have been contributing to an open-source application, [human essentials](https://staging.humanessentials.app/), an inventory tracking system used by donation centers across the country which was created and maintained by the non-profit group, [RubyForGood](https://rubyforgood.org/). A recent pull request I submitted that was merged into production can be seen [here](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper/pull/2267)
